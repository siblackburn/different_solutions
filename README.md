# Different Solutions

There are always many ways to solve a programming task. In this exercise you will practice to **read, understand, and comment on different solutions** to a coding challenge, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.

## The challenge

>Write a script that sorts a list of tuples based on the number value in the tuple.
>For example:
```python
unsorted_list = [('first_element', 4), ('second_element', 2), ('third_element', 6)]
sorted_list = [('second_element', 2), ('first_element', 4), ('third_element', 6)]
```

## Your turn!

1) Clone this repository!
2) Read over all solutions one-by-one
3) Create in-line code comments on the GitHub commits
    * what is done well?
    * what can be improved? (unnecessary code? style? logic? etc.)
4) Can you find yet another solution to the task? If so, add it to your repo!
